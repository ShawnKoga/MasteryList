<!-- You can use custom semantic HTML tags (ex. <toys>) in your document, but it is discouraged because at some point those tags may become standardized and not work the way you want them to anymore (it is suggested to make unique names to avoid this ex. my-toys) -->
<!-- Semantic HTML elements are HTML elements that have been named to clearly define (for both browsers and developers) different parts of a page. I often use <header>, <nav>, and <section> in my projects to break up the code visually and make it slightly easier to read. -->
<!-- To give content solid structure and value. Using <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer> is much better than a bunch of <div>s.  -->
<!-- Semantics help to leave content less ambiguous and assist with accessibility by providing more defined information to assistive technologies. -->
<!-- It is best practice to use semantics to avoid using ids and classes on every tag. Semantic tags vs. a bunch of div tags with ids and classes. It is also better practice to break up information you are giving with semantics. 
    ex. I am 5 feet and 10 inches
    /////should be/////
    <section>
        My height
        <dl>
            <dt>Feet: <dd> <meter min=0 max=7 value=5>5ft</meter>
            <dt>Inches: <dd> <meter min=0 max=12 value=11>11in</meter>
        </dl>
    </section> -->

    <!-- the doctype tag tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in. With HTML 4.01 you used to reference a DTD attribute. With HTML 5 you just do <!DOCTYPE html>. There are a ton of different DTD files you can reference for things like XHTML which allow you to do use different features. -->
